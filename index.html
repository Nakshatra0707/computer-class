    <p style="font-size: large;">School has been going on online for a while now, there was a short time where we were having physical school but it stopped in fear of a third wave during <a style="color: white;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diwali" target="_blank">Diwali</a> and <a style="color: white;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween" target="_blank">Halloween</a> (<a href="halloween.html" target="_blank" style="color: white;">Check out my halloween page</a>) time. I believe that concentrating and studying in physical school is much easier, along with that I can't wait to play sports again with all my friends. I used to carpool with 2 other people from my colony but now with the help of the buses it will become much easier.</p>
